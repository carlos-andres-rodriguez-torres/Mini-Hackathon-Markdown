*In this thesis, the focus is on understanding emergence in Large
Language Models (LLMs). Emergence refers to complex behaviors that arise
from interactions among individual components, even when those
components lack those behaviors individually. LLMs exhibit surprising
linguistic abilities beyond their constituent words or tokens. Assembly
Theory (AT) provides a framework for quantifying complexity without
altering fundamental physical laws. By applying AT to LLMs, this
research aims to uncover how emergent properties emerge from the
interplay of simple components.*

What is Emergence? Emergence refers to the phenomenon where a complex
system exhibits properties or behaviors that its individual components
do not possess in isolation. These emergent features arise only when the
components interact within a broader context. In philosophy, science,
and art, emergence plays a pivotal role in theories related to
integrative levels and complex systems. For example, life, as studied in
biology, emerges from the underlying chemistry and physics of biological
processes.

Emergence in Large Language Models Recent research has highlighted
emergent behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, such as
GPT-3, exhibit surprising capabilities beyond their individual
components (words or tokens). The interactions between countless
parameters give rise to emergent linguistic abilities, including natural
language understanding, generation, and context-based reasoning. For
further details, refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682

What is Assembly Theory (AT)? Assembly Theory (AT) provides a novel
framework for quantifying complexity without altering fundamental
physical laws. Unlike traditional point-particle models, AT defines
objects based on their potential formation histories. These \"objects\"
can exhibit evidence of selection within well-defined boundaries. AT
allows us to explore emergent properties by considering how components
assemble into coherent entities, shedding light on the intricate
dynamics of complex systems. See this paper for further information:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06600-9

Research Goals: This thesis aims to apply Assembly Theory to understand
emergence in Large Language Models. We will test AT in this particular
set emergence problem.

**Proposal 2: Automated Speech Analysis in Bipolar Disorder: Enhancing
Diagnosis and Monitoring.**

**Background**

Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a psychiatric condition in which people
experience significant shifts in mood, energy, and thought processes
during manic and depressive episodes (Nierenberg *et al.*, 2023). Manic
episodes involve heightened energy, rapid speech, and grandiose
thoughts, while depressive episodes are marked by low energy, slow
speech, and feelings of hopelessness.

Language, expressed through speech, provides a privileged window into
the mind and is thus a cornerstone of psychiatric evaluation. During
these evaluations, clinicians routinely assess speech features such as
(A) acoustic properties, (B) formal aspects, (C) language content, and
(D) emotionality, albeit subjectively.

1.  **Acoustic features** (**Table 1**) (e.g., pitch and volume) reflect
    mood states (Low, Bentley and Ghosh, 2020). Manic episodes might be
    characterized by increased pitch and loudness, while depressive
    episodes may present with reduced pitch variation and monotonous
    speech.
2.  **Formal aspects** (**Table 2**) (e.g., flow, fluency, rhythm,
    quantity, and latency) can delineate distinct patterns associated
    with different phases (euthymia, mania, depression) of BD (Weiner
    *et al.*, 2019). Overly rapid speech may indicate manic thought
    patterns, whereas slowed, halting speech can suggest depressive
    cognition.
3.  **Language content** **features** (**Table 3**) (e.g., coherence and
    cognition) reflects thought organization (Iter, Yoon and Jurafsky,
    2018). Manic episodes may involve tangential or circumstantial
    speech, while depressive episodes often include pervasive negative
    thoughts.
4.  **Emotionality features** (**Table 4**) (e.g., emotional valence and
    content) helps differentiate manic and depressive phases (Khorram
    *et al.*, 2018). Manic speech often conveys exaggerated positive
    emotions, whereas depressive speech typically reflects sadness and
    despair.

Modern technology enables high-fidelity speech recording and automated
analysis of these features (DeSouza *et al.*, 2021), showing potential
in diagnosing and monitoring BD (Guidi *et al.*, 2015; Faurholt-Jepsen
*et al.*, 2016).

We hypothesized that (i) speech features will correlate with the
severity of manic and depressive symptoms, (ii) they will effectively
differentiate between manic, depressive, and euthymic phases in BD, as
well as between mania/depression and response/remission, (iii) only
specific speech features and speech tasks will be relevant for each of
these analyses.

**Aims**

1.  To correlate speech features with manic-depressive symptoms severity
    in BDf
2.  To use speech features to develop predictive models for diagnostic
    (i.e., manic, depressive, and euthymic phases in BD), and treatment
    outcomes (i.e., acute phases of mania/depression vs
    response/remission)
3.  To determine which specific speech features and speech tasks are
    most relevant for each of the previous analyses.

**Methods**

A naturalistic, observational study was conducted. Patients with BD
experiencing manic and depressive episodes underwent longitudinal audio
recording during acute phases and after response/remission using a
dual-microphone setup. Patients during euthymia (mood stability) were
recorded once. Interviews included clinical evaluation, cognitive tasks,
standard text reading, and emotional and non-emotional storytelling
(**Figure 1**).

Audio recordings from 76 patients (24 manic, 21 depressed, 31 euthymic)
were collected. Among the patients in the acute phase, 17 manic patients
and 9 depressed patients were recorded longitudinally at clinical
remission. Sociodemographic and clinical data of the sample are reported
in **Table 5**. The average age was 48.1±13.3 years, and 64.6% were
female. The mean Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score for manic
patients was 24±8.5 (moderate-to-severe) during acute episodes, reducing
to 5.9±6.2 (mild-to-minimal symptoms) after response/remission.
Depressed patients had a mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17)
score of 17.1±4.4 (moderate-to-severe) during acute episodes, decreasing
to 3.3±2.8 (mild-to-minimal symptoms) after remission. Euthymic patients
exhibited mild-to-minimal symptoms (mean YMRS score of 0.97±1.4 and an
HDRS-17 score of 3.9±2.9).

Recordings were automatically diarized and transcribed.

**Plan**

1.  To extract speech features from the audio recordings, including (A)
    acoustic properties, (B) language content, (C) formal aspects,
    and (D) emotionality.
2.  Statistical analyses:

<!-- -->

1.  To correlate speech features with clinical scales, 
2.  To use lasso logistic regression to develop predictive models for
    diagnostic and treatment outcomes using speech features, and 
3.  To use variable relevance methods to identify the most pertinent
    speech features for these analyses, and assessing the magnitude of
    correlation and prediction accuracies across different speech tasks.

**Impact**: Automated speech analysis in BD might provide objective,
quantitative markers for psychopathological (manic/depressive)
alterations. This technology could potentially identify subtle
alterations imperceptible to clinicians, signaling early signs of acute
relapse and allowing for early intervention. Implementing this
technology could improve diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of
treatment response.

Cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important challenge for all
companies and individuals alike. While big names used to be the main
targets in the past, as people\'s lives move online, anyone is nowadays
a potential target for any kind of cyber-attack, ranging from phishing
to ransomware or serious privacy issues. In order to fight against those
ever-evolving threats, Machine Learning is increasingly being used
behind the scenes to design better systems that are able of
self-learning to boost detection rates and boost overall resilience to
unknown attacks. As AI-based solutions penetrate products across the
industry, a new kind of threat that is often overlooked is becoming more
and more prominent and dangerous: adversarial machine learning (AML).\
\
AML focuses on designing specific inputs to deceive a previously trained
Machine Learning models into misclassifying them for a specific purpose.
One of the main flaws of any state-of-the-art Machine Learning or Deep
Learning algorithms is that they assume that the nature of the data they
receive is systematically benign, which is generally the case but does
not hold true when an adversarial input is received. The motivation
behind altering a ML model into thinking that, for example, a new sample
is benign when in fact is malicious can range from pure research to more
serious real-life issues such as an autonomous car wrongly classifying a
stop sign (and thus provoking a fatal accident) or a wrongly diagnosed
disease because of a slightly manipulated magnetic resonance image.\
\
This problem is no exception for Cybersecurity where companies wrongly
assume that once the last AI-based product is deployed in their network,
their employees are safe\...

**LLM-as-a-judge for  Automated Speech Analysis in Bipolar Disorder**

**Background**

Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a psychiatric condition in which people
experience significant shifts in mood, energy, and thought processes
during manic and depressive episodes (Nierenberg *et al.*, 2023). Manic
episodes involve heightened energy, rapid speech, and grandiose
thoughts, while depressive episodes are marked by low energy, slow
speech, and feelings of hopelessness.

Language, expressed through speech, provides a privileged window into
the mind and is thus a cornerstone of psychiatric evaluation. During
these evaluations, clinicians routinely assess speech features such as
(A) acoustic properties, (B) formal aspects, (C) language content, and
(D) emotionality, albeit subjectively.

1.  **Acoustic features** (**Table 1**) (e.g., pitch and volume) reflect
    mood states (Low, Bentley and Ghosh, 2020). Manic episodes might be
    characterized by increased pitch and loudness, while depressive
    episodes may present with reduced pitch variation and monotonous
    speech.
2.  **Formal aspects** (**Table 2**) (e.g., flow, fluency, rhythm,
    quantity, and latency) can delineate distinct patterns associated
    with different phases (euthymia, mania, depression) of BD (Weiner
    *et al.*, 2019). Overly rapid speech may indicate manic thought
    patterns, whereas slowed, halting speech can suggest depressive
    cognition.
3.  **Language content** **features** (**Table 3**) (e.g., coherence and
    cognition) reflects thought organization (Iter, Yoon and Jurafsky,
    2018). Manic episodes may involve tangential or circumstantial
    speech, while depressive episodes often include pervasive negative
    thoughts.
4.  **Emotionality features** (**Table 4**) (e.g., emotional valence and
    content) helps differentiate manic and depressive phases (Khorram
    *et al.*, 2018). Manic speech often conveys exaggerated positive
    emotions, whereas depressive speech typically reflects sadness and
    despair.

Modern technology enables high-fidelity speech recording and automated
analysis of these features (DeSouza *et al.*, 2021), showing potential
in diagnosing and monitoring BD (Guidi *et al.*, 2015; Faurholt-Jepsen
*et al.*, 2016).

In recent years, a major breakthrough in the fields of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Speech Processing has been the rise of Large
Language Models (LLMs). These architectures utilize pretraining on
datasets containing billions or even trillions of words to generate
high-quality text across a wide range of topics and tasks. Due to their
impressive capabilities, recent studies have explored the potential of
LLMs to serve as evaluators in various tasks (Zheng et al., 2023). The
findings indicate that, with appropriately designed prompts, these
models can perform evaluations that exhibit strong correlations with
both human and automated assessments.

Simultaneously, the adaptation of LLMs to other data modalities, such as
speech and images, has shown remarkable progress in recent months (Peng
et al., 2024). These systems learn to map latent representations from
other data modalities into the latent space of a pretrained text-based
model. By mastering this mapping, it becomes possible to harness the
capabilities of the text model for other modalities and even integrate
multiple modalities within a single prompt.

**Aims**

1.  To study the latent space learned by an Speech LLM and how differemt
    modalities are represented.
2.  Device a prompt strategy to emulate human evaluation of Bipolar
    disorder. 
3.  Assess the reliability of LLMs for evaluation and their degree of
    correlation with human annotators.

**Methods**

A naturalistic, observational study was conducted. Patients with BD
experiencing manic and depressive episodes underwent longitudinal audio
recording during acute phases and after response/remission using a
dual-microphone setup. Patients during euthymia (mood stability) were
recorded once. Interviews included clinical evaluation, cognitive tasks,
standard text reading, and emotional and non-emotional storytelling
(**Figure 1**).

Audio recordings from 76 patients (24 manic, 21 depressed, 31 euthymic)
were collected. Among the patients in the acute phase, 17 manic patients
and 9 depressed patients were recorded longitudinally at clinical
remission. Sociodemographic and clinical data of the sample are reported
in **Table 5**. The average age was 48.1±13.3 years, and 64.6% were
female. The mean Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score for manic
patients was 24±8.5 (moderate-to-severe) during acute episodes, reducing
to 5.9±6.2 (mild-to-minimal symptoms) after response/remission.
Depressed patients had a mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17)
score of 17.1±4.4 (moderate-to-severe) during acute episodes, decreasing
to 3.3±2.8 (mild-to-minimal symptoms) after remission. Euthymic patients
exhibited mild-to-minimal symptoms (mean YMRS score of 0.97±1.4 and an
HDRS-17 score of 3.9±2.9).

Recordings were automatically diarized and transcribed.

**Plan**

1.  To extract speech features from the audio recordings, including (A)
    acoustic properties, (B) language content, (C) formal aspects,
    and (D) emotionality.
2.  Analysis of latent representation: Given audio recordings and
    transcriptions analyze how both modalities are represented by the
    LLM. We will focus on Semantic Reprentation of Speech and Text and
    the mapping between modalities.
3.   Design and compare different prompt strategies to evaluate audio
    recordings using in-context-learning techniques. 
4.   Evaluate the qualitiy of the automatic annotations. We will focus
    on two main aspects: Inter annotation agreement, how the LLM
    provides consistent results given similar recordings and its
    agreement with human annotators.

**Impact:** Automated speech analysis in bipolar disorder (BD) has the
potential to deliver objective and quantitative markers for identifying
psychopathological alterations associated with manic and depressive
episodes. Implementing an automated evaluation framework can enhance
consistency, accelerate assessments, and enable early intervention,
allowing for timely treatment before more severe symptoms emerge.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive
neuroimaging technique that measures changes in oxygenated (HbO2) and
deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) in the cerebral cortex. Due to its
portability and low cost, fNIRS has been used in Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) applications, characterizing hemodynamic responses to
varying stimuli, and investigating auditory and visual-spatial attention
during Complex Scene Analysis (CSA). In this project, we want to design
and implement an fNIRS study with a goal of studying the impact of
neural and BCI outcomes to improving the training of LAI models\'
attention mechanism (e.g., Transformer attention) during reading
comprehension tasks (e.g., the participants will be judging the quality
of generated text). We want to demonstrate experimentally that
augmenting a model with fNIRS data carries neural activity features
complementing the information captured by the model and demonstrate that
it improves the models\' performance. To this end, we will have to
collect data from participants and test how different Transformer models
benefit from different types of fNIRS attention masks.

Recent advancements in nanotechnology have enabled the development of
means for sensing and wireless communications with unprecedented
miniaturization and capabilities, to the point that they can be
introduced into the gastrointestinal tract inside a pill or into the
bloodstream in the form of passively flowing nanomachines. 

This opens the door to the idea of intra-body communication networks,
this is, a swarm of nanosensors inside the human body that use
communications to coordinate their actions to sense and localize
specific events (lack of oxygen, biomarkers, etc). This can lead to the
development of applications such as continuous monitoring of diabetes,
detection and localization of cancer micro-tumors, or early detection of
blood clots. These possibilities are currently investigated by our team
at the N3Cat (www.n3cat.upc.edu).

In this context, we are looking for excellent and self-motivated
individuals who are eager to work on developing AI schemes (based on
graph neural networks or multi-agent RL) for the detection and
localization of events inside of the human body. Data will be gathered
with an in-house simulator that integrates mobility models
(BloodVoyagerS) and communication models (TeraSim).

and in collaboration with Universitat Politècnica de València, working
in ONE of the following areas:

-   Study the use of AI to model quantum computers or to assist in the
    development of architectural methods (qubit mapping, qubit
    partitioning, qubit routing).
-   Study the potential scaling and adaptation of the existing quantum
