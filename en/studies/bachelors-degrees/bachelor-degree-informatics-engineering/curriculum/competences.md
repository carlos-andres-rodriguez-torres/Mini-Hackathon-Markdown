Under the new EHEA framework, graduates must possess a series of
technical competences closely linked to the demands of the professional
areas associated with the degree, and a group of generic competences
that should be acquired across all disciplines and specialisations.\
\
Competences are a combination of knowledge, skills (intellectual,
practical, social, etc), attitudes and values that enable individuals to
solve problems and to carry out tasks in a specific academic,
professional or social context.  \
\
A detailed description of generic competences defined by the UPC and of
specific competences set by FIB are given in the following pages.
